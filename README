=========================================================================

Generates .obd files with GROND OBs and might copy them to wgrond. These 
obd files can then be loaded into bob and executed or imported into p2pp

Options:
=========================================================================
-target    Target Name (required, resolved by SIMBAD, searches in XRT GRB positions)
-ob        OBs (required, e.g., 30 30 for two 30 min OBs)
-ra        Right ascension (if target not known)
-dec       Declination (if target not known)
-cp        Copy to wgrond directory to REMDIR (OBparams)
